## ðŸŽ¯ Hackiness Measurement Philosophy

This changelog reflects our journey from a complex GitHub App to a focused CLI tool that celebrates the full spectrum of development styles. We believe that:

- **All hackiness levels have value** - From methodical architects to spontaneous mavericks
- **Insight over judgment** - We provide understanding, not criticism
- **Celebration over correction** - Every coding style contributes to the ecosystem
- **Simplicity over complexity** - A CLI tool that just works, everywhere

## ðŸš€ Future Roadmap

### Planned Features
- **Language-Specific Hackiness**: Different patterns for different languages
- **Team Hackiness Dynamics**: How team composition affects overall hackiness
- **Hackiness Trends**: Track changes over time and project phases
- **Multi-Repository Comparison**: Compare hackiness across projects
- **Custom Metric Framework**: Let users define their own hackiness patterns

### Metric Expansion Ideas
- **Code Golf Tendency**: Concise vs. verbose coding patterns
- **Error Handling Style**: Try-catch vs. let-it-crash approaches
- **Testing Discipline**: TDD vs. "test in production" patterns
- **Configuration Chaos**: How much you tweak settings and configs
- **Dependency Boldness**: Willingness to use cutting-edge packages
