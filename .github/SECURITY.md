# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities. Which versions are eligible for receiving such patches depends on the CVSS v3.0 Rating:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our software products and services seriously, which includes all source code repositories managed through our GitHub organization.

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any of our repositories, please report it to us as described below.

### How to Report a Security Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via GitHub's security advisory feature:

1. Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/vuvuvu/HACKTOBER-DEV/security) of this repository
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Fill out the form with as much detail as possible

Alternatively, you can email us directly at: [security@example.com] (replace with actual email)

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

- Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

### Response Timeline

- We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours
- We will provide a detailed response within 7 days indicating next steps
- We will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement
- We may ask for additional information or guidance

### Safe Harbor

We support safe harbor for security researchers who:

- Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our services
- Only interact with accounts you own or with explicit permission of the account holder
- Do not access a system or account beyond what is necessary to demonstrate the vulnerability
- Report vulnerabilities as soon as you discover them
- Do not violate any other applicable laws or regulations
