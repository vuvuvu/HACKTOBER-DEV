# 🎯 Hackiness Measurement Tool - Product Requirements Document

## 📋 Executive Summary

The **Hacktober Dev Hackiness Analyzer** is a command-line tool that measures and celebrates the full spectrum of developer coding styles. Rather than judging "good" or "bad" practices, it quantifies where developers fall on the "hackiness spectrum" - from methodical architects to spontaneous mavericks - and provides insights that help developers understand their natural coding patterns.

## 🎨 Product Vision

**"Every developer has a unique coding style that contributes value to the software ecosystem. Our tool celebrates this diversity by measuring 'hackiness levels' - not to judge, but to provide insight, encouragement, and community connection around different development approaches."**

## 🎯 Core Objectives
